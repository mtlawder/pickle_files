    "Basically this entity is the public market place where energy is bought and sold in real-time between Large Scale Generators, Electric Utilities, Electric Co-ops, and any other large entity that wishes to purchase or generate power.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prices for a MWh of energy flucuate both temporally and geogrpahically. To get the price the at given location, we start with the base set price from MISO. MISO sets a base price (for a given time) that is the same across the entire region. Then at each point a Marginal Loss Cost (MLC) is subtracted from the value. The MLC is based on the physical loss locaaly at the node point and does not flucuate much throughout MISO. Then a Marginal Congestion Cost (MCC) is subtracted (or added if it's negative) to the base price. This final value is the Location Marginal Price (LMP).\n",
    "\n",
    "LMP=Base Price-MLC-MCC\n",
    "\n",
    "The MCC is based on a combination of factors and can vary greatly between points. Estenially the MCC accounts for the cost of trnasmiting energy from where it is generated to where it is demanded. For locations that have lots of generation and low demand the MCC will be high, driving down the price of energy (and sometimes making it negative). THis can occur in places like Iowa that may be generating lots of energy from wind power overnight, but do not have sufficient transmission to send the energy where it is demanded. The opposite case can also occur. High demand and low generation will drive prices up.\n",

    "With the data properly formatted into SQL, we can begin to allow query searches for how the prices change over multiple years. For most utilities or customers who are purchasing power, they will lock in at long term fixed rates. They will have to buy the power at the price and sell it into the grid at the market price (unless they are local to the generation). The difference in their fixed price will determine if they make money or lose money each hour of the day.\n",

    "Questions to be answered:\n",
    "\n",
    "If an organization locks in a fixed power price from a single generator when will they make profit from that power and when will they lose money?\n",
    "\n",
    "If an organization sells power into the grid at the generation site and buys out at it's local node. What is the difference between those points? This value account for average \"Transmission\" costs. "
